# Welcome to The Odin Project and My attempt at Rock Paper Scissors

The Odin Project (also known as TOP) is an open-source community for learning full-stack web development. Their mission is to provide a comprehensive curriculum to learn web development for free. We help our students learn the skills and build the impressive portfolio of projects they need to get hired as a web developer.

In the web development section, the first task we are given is to create a rps game that works in the browser. I wanted to try a  little more.

I will be adding stuff regularly and revisiting the idea of rps game as my knowledge improves.

The initial commit doesn't have a working end game function. It will be added!
